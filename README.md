1️⃣ Star the Repository

Click the ⭐ Star button at the top right of this page.
It helps others discover this project and shows your support for open-source contributors like you!

2️⃣ Fork the Repo

Click Fork on the top-right of this page.
This creates a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

3️⃣ Clone Your Fork

Now, bring the project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Hacktoberfest-2025.git
cd Hacktoberfest-2025
```

4️⃣ Set Up Remotes

Check that your local repository points to your fork:
```bash
git remote -v
```
Then, connect it to the original repo so you can stay updated:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Open-Source-you/Hacktoberfest-2025.git
```
5️⃣ Stay Synced

Before making any changes, always keep your local copy updated:
```bash
git fetch --all --prune
git checkout main
git reset --hard upstream/main
git push origin main
```
This ensures you’re always working with the latest version of the project.

6️⃣ Create a New Branch

Avoid editing directly on the main branch.
Instead, create a new branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```
7️⃣ Make Your Changes & Commit

Now, make your contribution — add code, fix bugs, improve docs, or add your name to a list!
Then commit your work:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added my first open source contribution 🚀"
```
8️⃣ Push & Open a Pull Request

Push your branch to your forked repository:
```bash
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```
Then open your GitHub repo → click “Compare & Pull Request”,
add a meaningful title and short description — and hit Create Pull Request. 🎉
